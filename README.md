# Python-Snake-Game
This is a recreation of classical game snake made with python and the pygame library.

When you want to take a look at the source code you can download the main branch. The game as an executable or an app is a release.

## Requirements
You need to install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt if you don't already have it, in case you are executing the source code.
Pip has an implemented feature for automatically installing requirement lists. The command usually is `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Information for KDE-Plasma users
When you are using pygame windows in KDE Plasma the compositor gets blocked and all compositor animations stop working. If you still want the animations, you should go into the compositor settings and disable the option, that apps may block the compositor. (This is the last option in the compositor settings)

## Download game
The official game download can be found on the official [itch.io page](https://alpha-craft.itch.io/pysnake). You can also install it with the itch app for more convenience.
