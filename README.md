# Python-Snake-Game
This is a recreation of classical game snake made with python and the pygame library.

When you want to take a look at the source code you can download the main branch. The game as an executable or an app is a release.

## Requirements
You need to install pygame manually if you don't already have it, in case you are executing the source code.

## Information for KDE-Plasma users
When you are using pygame windows in Plama the compositor get's blocked and all system animations stop working. I you still want the system animations, you should go into the compositor settings and disable the option, that apps may block the compositor. (This is the last option in the compositor settings)
