# Python-Snake-Game
This is a recreation of classical game snake made with python and the pygame library.

When you want to take a look at the source code you can download the (SOURCE) zip file. The actual game with no other stuff is in the (EXE) zip file with the executable.
I'll add comments to the code soon.
